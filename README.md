## Toiler

Toiler is a AWS SQS long-polling thread-based message processor.
It's based on [shoryuken](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken) but takes
a different approach at loadbalancing and uses long-polling.

## Features

### Concurrency

Toiler allows to specify the amount of processors (threads) that should be spawned for each queue.
Instead of [shoryuken's](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken) loadbalancing  approach, Toiler delegates this work to the kernel scheduling threads.

### Long-Polling

A Fetcher thread is spawned for each queue.
Fetchers are resposible for polling SQS and retreiving messages.
They are optimised to not bring more messages than the amount of processors avaiable for such queue.
By long-polling fetchers wait for a configurable amount of time for messages to become available on a single request, this prevents unneccesarilly requesting messages when there are none.

### Message Parsing

Workers can configure a parser Class or Proc to parse an SQS message body before being processed.

### Batches

Toiler allows a Worker to be able to receive a batch of messages instead of a single one.

### Auto Visibility Extension

Toiler has the ability to automatically extend the visibility timeout of and SQS message to prevent the message from re-entering the queue if processing of such message is taking longer than the queue's visibility timeout.

## Instalation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'toiler'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install toiler

## Usage

### Worker class

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Toiler::Worker

  toiler_options queue: 'default', concurrency: 5, auto_delete: true
  toiler_options parser: :json

  # toiler_options parser: ->(sqs_msg){ REXML::Document.new(sqs_msg.body) }
  # toiler_options parser: MultiJson
  # toiler_options auto_visibility_timeout: true
  # toiler_options batch: true
  # toiler_options queue: 'subscription', concurrency: 5, auto_delete: true, provider: :gcp, provider_config: { project_id: 'my-project' }

  #Example connection client that should be shared across all instances of MyWorker
  @@client = ConnectionClient.new
    
  def initialize
    @last_message = nil
  end

  def perform(sqs_msg, body)
    #Workers are thread safe, yay!
    #Each worker instance is assured to be processing only one message at a time
    @last_message = sqs_msg 
    puts body
  end
end
```

### Configuration

```yaml
aws:
  access_key_id:      ...       # or <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>
  secret_access_key:  ...       # or <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
  region:             us-east-1 # or <%= ENV['AWS_REGION'] %>
wait: 20                        # The time in seconds to wait for messages during long-polling
```

### Rails Integration

You can tell Toiler to load your Rails application by passing the `-R` or `--rails` flag to the "toiler" command.

If you load Rails, and assuming your workers are located in the `app/workers` directory, they will be auto-loaded. This means you don't need to require them explicitly with `-r`.


### Start Toiler

```shell
bundle exec toiler -r worker.rb -C toiler.yml
```

Other options:

```bash
toiler --help

    -d, --daemon                     Daemonize process
    -r, --require [PATH|DIR]         Location of the worker
    -q, --queue QUEUE1,QUEUE2,...    Queues to process
    -C, --config PATH                Path to YAML config file
    -R, --rails                      Load Rails
    -L, --logfile PATH               Path to writable logfile
    -P, --pidfile PATH               Path to pidfile
    -v, --verbose                    Print more verbose output
    -h, --help                       Show help
```
